# Refactor Report – Prompt 26 Consolidation Pass

Status: Draft (update metrics post final merge)

## Overview
Prompt 26 focused on unifying tolerances & constants, introducing a formal mapping inventory, adding deterministic statistics artifacts, tightening evaluator/index implementations, and eliminating legacy / divergent code paths (notably ad?hoc Earth/Moon handling and scattered literals).

## High?Level Outcomes
- Central `TolerancePolicy` established; all numeric tolerance literals removed elsewhere (enforced by test `NoToleranceLiteralsOutsidePolicy`).
- Mapping inventory (`Spice.IntegrationTests/TestData/BodyMapping.json`) created with validation test (duplicates + required Earth/Moon entries).
- Real SPK segment parser & evaluator hardened: record size / count validation, binary search selection with boundary fast path, cycle guard in barycentric recursion.
- Control word decoding clarified; dual encoding (double vs synthetic 32?bit) covered by dedicated tests.
- Stats JSON artifact (`comparison_stats.<eph>.json`) emitted per ephemeris; schema validated both at generation time and via integration test sweep.
- Documentation synchronized: tolerance narrative only in `docs/Tolerances.md`; roadmap canonicalized in root `README.md`; barycentric chaining note added (`docs/SpkDafFormat.md`).

## Metrics (Provisional – replace with actual counts)
| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Files touched | TBD | Consolidation scope across IO, Kernels, Ephemeris, Tests, Docs |
| Lines removed | TBD | Expect net negative vs additions for duplicated literals & redundant docs |
| Lines added | TBD | Primarily tests + central policy + docs |
| Tolerance literals purged | 8 | (2e-14, 3e-17, 6e-14, 5e-14, 2e-12, 5e-15, 5e-8, 1e-10) now only in `TolerancePolicy` |
| New unit tests | +5 | Control words, record selection, tolerance tiers, mapping validation, stats schema |
| New integration assertions | +1 | In?situ stats schema check during generation |
| New docs added/updated | 4 | README, Prompt26, SpkDafFormat, this report |
| New helper types | 2 | `DafAddress`, `SegmentListIndex` (internal) |

(Replace "TBD" with concrete values after final diff – can script via `git diff --shortstat <baseline>`.)

## Key Code Changes
- `FullDafReader`: introduced `DafAddress`; refactored control word logic with explicit fallback branches; added tests for both encodings.
- `RealSpkKernelParser`: strict validation `(final - initial + 1) == rsize * n + 4`; trailer extraction; per?record MID/RADIUS arrays.
- `SpkSegmentEvaluator`: binary search record selection with defensive linear fallback.
- `EphemerisService`: segment index arrays (starts + stops), fast boundary path, barycentric cycle guard, LINQ hot path removal.
- Tests: Added synthetic DAF control word suite, boundary record evaluation tests, tolerance tier matrix tests, body mapping validation, stats JSON schema validation.

## Removed / Eliminated
- Earth/Moon special?case derivation logic (replaced by generic barycentric chaining).
- Scattered tolerance literals in test & harness code.
- Redundant roadmap / tolerance duplication in secondary READMEs.

## Risk Mitigations Implemented
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Hidden tolerance literal | Automated search test (`NoToleranceLiteralsOutsidePolicy`). |
| Mapping drift / duplicates | Central JSON + validation test ensures uniqueness & required pairs. |
| Stats artifact schema regressions | Generation?time schema validation + integration sweep. |
| Control word regression | Dedicated unit tests exercise double & synthetic encodings. |
| Barycentric recursion cycle | Visited set guard in `EphemerisService.TryResolveBarycentric`. |
| Record lookup performance regression | Binary search + boundary fast path; optional micro?benchmark placeholder (future). |

## Follow?Up (Post Prompt 26)
1. Optional micro benchmarks (record selection vs synthetic linear, barycentric warm vs cold).
2. CSPICE numeric parity harness (tighten "strict" tolerance confirmation).
3. Public API analyzer shipped baseline (lock surface before further feature prompts).
4. Diagnostic CLI enrichment (segment coverage listing via future public diagnostic interface).

## Validation Summary
All unit & integration tests pass with consolidated policy in effect; stats JSON emitted deterministically and schema validated. No public surface changes introduced during consolidation (final API lock pending).

## Appendix: Suggested Automation Snippets
```bash
# Lines removed / added relative to baseline tag vPrompt26Phase0
git diff --shortstat vPrompt26Phase0..HEAD

# Count tolerance literals outside policy (should be zero)
grep -R "2e-14\|3e-17\|6e-14\|5e-14\|2e-12\|5e-15\|5e-8\|1e-10" -n . \
  | grep -v TolerancePolicy.cs || echo "No stray literals"
```
